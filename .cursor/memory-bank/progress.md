# Progress: Jose Backend

## What Works

### Core Setup

- âœ… NestJS application structure established
- âœ… TypeScript configuration
- âœ… ESLint and Prettier setup
- âœ… Configuration management with @nestjs/config

### Schedule Feature

- âœ… Database connection to Neon PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- âœ… Normalized Prisma schema with Teacher, Room, Subject, TimeSlot, and Schedule models
- âœ… DTO classes with validation (CreateScheduleDto, UpdateScheduleDto)
- âœ… Schedule entity defined with business logic methods
- âœ… Fixed time slots implementation (5:45-6:45pm, 6:45-7:45pm, 7:45-8:45pm)
- âœ… Day constraints (Monday-Saturday, no Sunday)
- âœ… Basic CRUD operations implemented
- âœ… Controller endpoints with Swagger documentation
- âœ… Repository pattern with ScheduleRepositoryService
- âœ… Mapper pattern with ScheduleMapperService
- âœ… Service layer with ScheduleService focusing on business logic
- âœ… Current class identification based on time
- âœ… Day-based filtering
- âœ… Database seed script with sample data for all supported days

### Code Organization

- âœ… Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- âœ… Repository pattern implementation for database operations
- âœ… Mapper pattern for entity transformations
- âœ… Constants directory for enums and shared values
- âœ… Common types directory for shared regex patterns
- âœ… Barrel exports (index.ts files) for cleaner imports
- âœ… Proper error handling with logging in service methods

### Infrastructure

- âœ… Environment variable configuration
- âœ… Swagger documentation setup
- âœ… Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- âœ… Prisma service for dependency injection

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term

- ðŸ”² Write unit tests for service methods
- ðŸ”² Write unit tests for repository and mapper services
- ðŸ”² Implement pagination for schedule listings
- ðŸ”² Add sorting options for schedule endpoints
- ðŸ”² Add filtering by teacher name and subject
- ðŸ”² Add more validation rules for edge cases

### Medium-term

- ðŸ”² User authentication system
- ðŸ”² Role-based access control
- ðŸ”² Logging system for auditing
- ðŸ”² Rate limiting for API endpoints
- ðŸ”² Implement health checks

### Long-term

- ðŸ”² Additional features beyond schedule management
- ðŸ”² Expense tracking module
- ðŸ”² Mobile app frontend
- ðŸ”² Analytics and reporting
- ðŸ”² Push notifications

## Current Status

The application has a functioning Schedule module with the ability to:

- Create, read, update, and delete schedule entries with strict validation
- Only allow schedules on Monday through Saturday (no Sunday)
- Only allow specific time slots (5:45-6:45pm, 6:45-7:45pm, 7:45-8:45pm)
- Get the current active class based on the time of day
- Filter schedules by day of the week
- Access properly documented API via Swagger UI

Code architecture has been improved with:

- Implementation of Repository Pattern to isolate database operations
- Implementation of Mapper Pattern for entity transformations
- Proper separation of business logic from data access
- Enhanced type safety throughout the application
- Normalized database schema with proper relationships

The application runs on port 3001 (changed from 3000 to avoid conflicts).

## Known Issues

1. **Port Conflict**: There may be issues with port 3000 being used by another application, which is why the port was changed to 3001.

2. **Time Format Handling**: The application now enforces specific time slots, but timezone differences still need to be considered for worldwide usage.

3. **Missing Pagination**: The endpoints that return multiple schedules don't support pagination yet, which could cause performance issues with large datasets.

4. **Limited Testing**: The application lacks comprehensive test coverage, which is needed for ensuring reliability.

5. **Complex Database Relationships**: The normalized database schema may introduce complexity in query operations, which should be monitored for performance.

This document will be updated regularly as development progresses and as additional features are implemented.
