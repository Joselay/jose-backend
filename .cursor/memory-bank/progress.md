# Progress: Jose Backend

## What Works

### Core Setup

- ✅ NestJS application structure established
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier setup
- ✅ Configuration management with @nestjs/config

### Schedule Feature

- ✅ Database connection to Neon PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- ✅ Normalized Prisma schema with Teacher, Room, Subject, TimeSlot, and Schedule models
- ✅ DTO classes with validation (CreateScheduleDto, UpdateScheduleDto)
- ✅ Schedule entity defined with business logic methods
- ✅ Fixed time slots implementation (5:45-6:45pm, 6:45-7:45pm, 7:45-8:45pm)
- ✅ Day constraints (Monday-Saturday, no Sunday)
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations implemented
- ✅ Controller endpoints with Swagger documentation
- ✅ Repository pattern with ScheduleRepositoryService
- ✅ Mapper pattern with ScheduleMapperService
- ✅ Service layer with ScheduleService focusing on business logic
- ✅ Current class identification based on time
- ✅ Day-based filtering
- ✅ Database seed script with sample data for all supported days

### Teacher Feature

- ✅ Teacher entity with CRUD operations
- ✅ Avatar support for teacher profiles
- ✅ File upload functionality for avatars
- ✅ Cloudinary integration for cloud storage
- ✅ Optimized avatar endpoints in API
- ✅ Swagger documentation for teacher endpoints

### File Management

- ✅ Upload service for handling file uploads
- ✅ Cloudinary integration for all file storage
- ✅ Secure URL generation for uploaded files
- ✅ Image optimization via Cloudinary
- ✅ Proper error handling for uploads
- ✅ Validation for missing Cloudinary credentials

### Code Organization

- ✅ Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Repository pattern implementation for database operations
- ✅ Mapper pattern for entity transformations
- ✅ Constants directory for enums and shared values
- ✅ Common types directory for shared regex patterns
- ✅ Barrel exports (index.ts files) for cleaner imports
- ✅ Proper error handling with logging in service methods

### Infrastructure

- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Swagger documentation setup with authentication
- ✅ Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Prisma service for dependency injection
- ✅ CORS configuration

### API Integration

- ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive API endpoints for all features
- ✅ Input validation with class-validator
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes and responses
- ✅ Secure authentication for Swagger documentation

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term

- 🔲 Write unit tests for service methods
- 🔲 Write unit tests for repository and mapper services
- 🔲 Implement pagination for schedule listings
- 🔲 Add sorting options for schedule endpoints
- 🔲 Add filtering by teacher name and subject
- 🔲 Add more validation rules for edge cases
- 🔲 File type and size validation for uploads

### Medium-term

- 🔲 User authentication system
- 🔲 Role-based access control
- 🔲 Logging system for auditing
- 🔲 Rate limiting for API endpoints
- 🔲 Implement health checks
- 🔲 Image processing for avatars (resize, crop)

### Long-term

- 🔲 Additional features beyond schedule management
- 🔲 Expense tracking module
- 🔲 Mobile app frontend
- 🔲 Analytics and reporting
- 🔲 Push notifications

## Current Status

The application has a functioning Schedule module with the ability to:

- Create, read, update, and delete schedule entries with strict validation
- Only allow schedules on Monday through Saturday (no Sunday)
- Only allow specific time slots (5:45-6:45pm, 6:45-7:45pm, 7:45-8:45pm)
- Get the current active class based on the time of day
- Filter schedules by day of the week
- Access properly documented API via Swagger UI with password protection

The application now also includes a Teacher module with:

- Complete CRUD operations for teacher records
- Avatar management with file upload support
- Integration with Cloudinary for all file storage
- RESTful API endpoints with Swagger documentation

Code architecture has been improved with:

- Implementation of Repository Pattern to isolate database operations
- Implementation of Mapper Pattern for entity transformations
- Proper separation of business logic from data access
- Enhanced type safety throughout the application
- Normalized database schema with proper relationships

The application runs on port 3000.

## Known Issues

1. **Time Format Handling**: The application enforces specific time slots, but timezone differences still need to be considered for worldwide usage.

2. **Missing Pagination**: The endpoints that return multiple schedules don't support pagination yet, which could cause performance issues with large datasets.

3. **Limited Testing**: The application lacks comprehensive test coverage, which is needed for ensuring reliability.

4. **Complex Database Relationships**: The normalized database schema may introduce complexity in query operations, which should be monitored for performance.

5. **File Upload Limitations**: File uploads currently lack size and type validation, which should be added for security.

This document will be updated regularly as development progresses and as additional features are implemented.
